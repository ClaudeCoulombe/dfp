Take, for example, a robot we might want to train to open a door. Reinforcement learning can be used as a framework for teaching the robot to open the door by allowing it to learn from trial and error. But what if we are interested in having our agent solve not just one goal, but a set that might vary over time?\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:150%\"><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/reinforcement-learning-explained\">Reinforcement learning</a> involves agents interacting in some environment to maximize obtained rewards over time. This is typically formalized in the following way: an agent receives a state $(s)$ from the environment, and produces an action $(a)$. Given this state and action pair, the environment then provides the agent a new state $(s′)$ and a reward $(r)$. The reinforcement learning problem is then to discover a mapping from states to actions, which produce the greatest amount of cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to this is called Q-learning, in which we learn a direct mapping between state and action pairs $(s,a)$ and value estimations $(v)$. This value estimation should correspond to the discounted expected reward over time from taking action $(a)$ while in state $(s)$. Using the Bellman equation, we can iteratively update our estimations of $Q(s,a)$ for all possible state action pairs. This capacity to iteratively update the Q-value comes from the following property of an optimal Q-function:\n",

    "<center>$\\large{Q^*(s,a)=\\;r\\;+\\;\\gamma\\;max_{a′}Q(s′,a′)}$</center><br/>\n",

    "The above means that the current Q-value for a given state $(s)$ and action $(a)$ can be decomposed into the current reward $(r)$ plus the discounted expected future reward $\\gamma\\;max_{a′}Q(s′,a′)$ in the next state. By collecting experiences, we can train a neural network to predict more accurate Q-values over time, and by taking actions that optimize the expected value, we can then, ideally, obtain the greatest cumulative reward possible from the environment. Using a universal function approximator such as a neural network, we can generalize our Q-estimation to unseen states, allowing us to learn Q-functions for arbitrarily large state spaces.</div>"

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:150%\">Given enough time, and the correct hyperparameter tuning, the Q-learning algorithm could eventually discover that recharging the battery is beneficial to delivering more packages in the long-term. This involves learning to take a complex series of actions for no immediate reward, in the understanding that a greater reward will come later. In this case, it is a tempting option to augment the reward signal to encourage battery-rewarding behavior. A naïve approach might be to provide a reward (say +0.5) for flying to the specified location to recharge the battery. What our agent will learn in this situation, however, is to simply always fly to the recharge station, since there is a guaranteed reward every time it charges itself. What we run into now is the problem of coming up with a reward function that describes the kind of behavior we believe to be optimal. While this is simple for some problems, there are often unintended consequences of posing the reward function incorrectly. For some examples, see this recent OpenAI article, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/faulty-reward-functions/\">“Faulty Reward Functions.”</a></div><br/>"

    "<div style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:150%\">If we want to avoid the pitfalls of bad reward engineering, we need a more intuitive way to convey the structure of the task to our agent. It turns out that by providing our agent with an explicit goal that can vary based on both the episode and specific moment, we are better able to get the kinds of dynamic behaviors we want. In the case of the battery, we can simply change the goal from “deliver packages” to “recharge battery” once the battery is below a certain capacity. In this way, we don’t have to worry about reward formulation, and the neural network can just focus on learning the environment dynamics themselves.</div><br/>"

I have adjusted a few elements to make them more intuitive for the simple example discussed in this article.\n",

Instead of predicting a value function like in Q-learning, we train our network to predict the expected future changes in battery and deliveries at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 steps into the future.

Imagine that we have a measurement vector [battery, deliveries]. If we want to maximize battery charge but ignore deliveries, then our goal would be [1 , 0], which would correspond to desiring a positive battery measurement in the future and indifference to the number of deliveries.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "If we wanted to maximize deliveries, our goal would be [0, 1]. Since we (rather than the environment or the network itself) formulate the goal, we are free to change it at every time-step as we see fit. In this way, we can explicitly change the goal from optimizing deliveries to optimizing the battery, whenever the battery measurement drops below a certain threshold (in our case, 30% charge). By combining goals and measurement in this way, we now can flexibly adjust our agent’s behavior on the fly, depending on the desire of the human operator. This is in contrast to Q-learning, where the Q-values would remain fixed after training, and only a single behavior pattern would be possible.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "This new formulation changes our neural network in several ways. Instead of just a state, we will also provide as input to the network the current measurements and goal.
